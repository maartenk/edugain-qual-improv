## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install the CLI

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install edugain-analysis
```

Prefer running from a clone? Install in editable mode instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maartenk/edugain-qual-improv.git
cd edugain-qual-improv
python -m pip install -e .
```

After installation, your environment exposes the CLI entry points `edugain-analyze`, `edugain-seccon`, `edugain-sirtfi`, and `edugain-broken-privacy`. They live in the Python environment’s `bin/` (or `Scripts\` on Windows) like any other console scripts.

Want to run from a clone without installing?

```bash
# Shell wrappers (from repo root)
./scripts/app/edugain-analyze.sh --report
./scripts/app/edugain-seccon.sh
./scripts/app/edugain-sirtfi.sh
./scripts/app/edugain-broken-privacy.sh

# Direct module invocation
python -m edugain_analysis.cli.main

# Convenience wrapper (repo root)
python analyze.py
```

### Run your first analysis

```bash
# Summary of privacy, security contacts, and SIRTFI coverage
edugain-analyze

# Detailed markdown report grouped by federation
edugain-analyze --report

# CSV export of entities missing privacy statements
edugain-analyze --csv missing-privacy

# Validate privacy statement URLs while producing the summary
edugain-analyze --validate
```

## 📋 Command Reference

| Command | Purpose | Helpful options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `edugain-analyze` | Main privacy/security/SIRTFI analysis | `--report`, `--csv <type>`, `--validate`, `--source <file-or-url>` |
| `edugain-seccon` | Entities with security contacts but no SIRTFI | `--local-file`, `--no-headers` |
| `edugain-sirtfi` | Entities with SIRTFI but no security contact | `--local-file`, `--no-headers` |
| `edugain-broken-privacy` | Service Providers with broken privacy links | `--local-file`, `--no-headers`, `--url <metadata-url>` |

All commands default to the live eduGAIN aggregate metadata. Supply `--source path.xml` or `--source https://custom` to work with alternative metadata files.

### `edugain-analyze`
The primary CLI for day-to-day reporting. Generates summaries, CSV exports, and markdown reports in one pass.

```bash
# Quick snapshot with SIRTFI coverage in the summary
edugain-analyze

# Markdown report plus live privacy URL checks
edugain-analyze --report-with-validation

# Export only SPs missing both safeguards
edugain-analyze --csv missing-both --no-headers > missing.csv
```

### `edugain-seccon`
Surfaces entities that publish a security contact but have not completed SIRTFI certification—ideal for prioritizing follow-up.

```bash
# Live metadata
edugain-seccon

# Offline review against a cached aggregate
edugain-seccon --local-file reports/metadata.xml
```

### `edugain-sirtfi`
Flags entities that claim SIRTFI compliance yet fail to list a security contact, highlighting policy violations.

```bash
# Focus on current gaps
edugain-sirtfi

# Custom feed (e.g., private federation snapshot)
edugain-sirtfi --url https://example/federation.xml
```

### `edugain-broken-privacy`
Targets Service Providers with privacy statement URLs that fail a lightweight accessibility check.

```bash
# Default live run with 10 parallel validators
edugain-broken-privacy

# Skip headers when piping into other tooling
edugain-broken-privacy --no-headers | tee broken-urls.csv
```

## 📤 CSV & Report Exports

`edugain-analyze --csv` supports the following types (all include SIRTFI columns):

- `entities` – complete view of all entities
- `federations` – per-federation roll-up
- `missing-privacy`, `missing-security`, `missing-both`
- `urls` – privacy statement URLs for SPs
- `urls-validated` – includes HTTP status data (enables live validation)

Markdown reports are produced with `--report` (or `--report-with-validation` to perform live URL checks while generating the report).

**CSV Columns**

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Federation` | Friendly federation name (API-backed) |
| `EntityType` | `SP` or `IdP` |
| `OrganizationName` | Display name from metadata |
| `EntityID` | SAML entity identifier |
| `HasPrivacyStatement` | `Yes`/`No` (SPs only) |
| `PrivacyStatementURL` | Declared privacy URL (SPs) |
| `HasSecurityContact` | `Yes`/`No` |
| `HasSIRTFI` | `Yes`/`No` |
| *(with validation)* `URLStatusCode`, `FinalURL`, `URLAccessible`, `RedirectCount`, `ValidationError` |

## 🔗 URL Validation (optional)

Enabling `--validate`, `--report-with-validation`, or `--csv urls-validated` triggers live HTTP checks for privacy statement URLs. Results are cached for seven days to avoid repeat lookups. When validation runs, extra columns are appended to CSV exports:

- `URLStatusCode`, `FinalURL`, `URLAccessible`, `RedirectCount`, `ValidationError`

## 📄 Privacy Page Content Quality Analysis (optional)

`--validate-content` goes beyond HTTP status checks and inspects the actual HTML of each privacy statement page. It detects soft-404s, thin content, and missing GDPR-related language — problems that a plain HTTP 200 would never surface.

This flag implies `--validate`, so you do not need to pass both.

```bash
# Content quality analysis with terminal summary
edugain-analyze --validate-content

# Export per-URL content analysis to CSV
edugain-analyze --csv urls-content-analysis
```

### Quality score

Each privacy page receives a score from 0 to 100:

| Tier | Score range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Excellent | 90–100 | Page passes all quality checks |
| Good | 70–89 | Minor issues (e.g. few GDPR keywords, slightly slow) |
| Fair | 50–69 | Notable issues needing attention |
| Poor | 30–49 | Significant problems affecting compliance |
| Broken | 0–29 | Soft-404, empty page, or severe combined issues |

### Quality issues detected

| Issue string | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `soft-404` | Page returns HTTP 200 but displays error content (e.g. "Page not found") |
| `thin-content` | HTML content under 500 bytes — almost certainly not a real privacy page |
| `empty-content` | HTML under 100 bytes — effectively blank |
| `non-https` | Privacy URL uses plain HTTP instead of HTTPS |
| `no-gdpr-keywords` | Page contains fewer than 2 recognised GDPR-related terms |
| `few-gdpr-keywords` | Page contains only 2 keywords (3 or more expected) |
| `slow-response` | Page took longer than 5 seconds to respond |
| `very-slow-response` | Page took longer than 10 seconds to respond |

GDPR keyword detection covers five languages: English, German, French, Spanish, and Swedish. Language is auto-detected from the page's `<html lang>` attribute or by keyword frequency.

### `--csv urls-content-analysis`

Exports one row per SP privacy URL with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Federation` | Friendly federation name |
| `EntityID` | SAML entity identifier |
| `PrivacyURL` | Privacy statement URL |
| `StatusCode` | HTTP response code |
| `ContentQualityScore` | Score 0–100 |
| `HTTPS` | `True`/`False` |
| `ContentLength` | Raw HTML size in bytes |
| `HasGDPRKeywords` | `True` if 2+ keywords found |
| `KeywordCount` | Number of GDPR keywords matched |
| `IsSoft404` | `True` if a soft-404 was detected |
| `DetectedLanguage` | ISO 639-1 code (e.g. `en`, `de`) or blank |
| `ResponseTimeMs` | Fetch time in milliseconds |
| `QualityIssues` | Pipe-separated list of issue strings (e.g. `thin-content\|non-https`) |

See [docs/content-quality-analysis.md](docs/content-quality-analysis.md) for a full reference including the scoring algorithm and remediation guidance.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Runtime defaults live in `src/edugain_analysis/config/settings.py`. Tweak them if you need to point at alternative metadata sources or adjust validation behaviour.

- `EDUGAIN_METADATA_URL`, `EDUGAIN_FEDERATIONS_API`: swap these when working with staging aggregates or private federation indexes.
- Cache knobs (`METADATA_CACHE_HOURS`, `FEDERATION_CACHE_DAYS`, `URL_VALIDATION_CACHE_DAYS`) define how long downloads are reused; shorten them during rapid testing, extend them to reduce network traffic.
- URL validation controls (`URL_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT`, `URL_VALIDATION_DELAY`, `URL_VALIDATION_THREADS`, `MAX_CONTENT_SIZE`) let you balance accuracy with load on remote sites.
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` covers metadata and federation lookups; bump it for slow-on-purpose mirrors.

After adjusting the settings file, re-run the CLI—changes take effect immediately because the module is imported at runtime.

## 📦 Metadata & Caching

- **Default source**: eduGAIN aggregate metadata (`https://mds.edugain.org/edugain-v2.xml`)
- **Overrides**: Use `--source path.xml` for local files or `--url` (where available) for alternate feeds
- **Caching**: Metadata (12h), federation mapping (30d), and URL validation results (7d) are cached in the XDG cache directory (typically `~/.cache/edugain-analysis/`)

## 🧰 Advanced (optional)

- Run from source: `python analyze.py` mirrors `edugain-analyze`
- Use Docker: `docker compose build` then `docker compose run --rm cli -- --help` (defaults to `edugain-analyze`; swap in `edugain-seccon`, `edugain-sirtfi`, or `edugain-broken-privacy` as needed)
- Batch everything locally: `scripts/dev/local-ci.sh` runs linting, tests, coverage, and Docker smoke tests
- Tweak the helper via env vars: `SKIP_COVERAGE=1` or `SKIP_DOCKER=1` to skip heavier steps

## 🛠️ Developer Setup

The Makefile now provides an end-user-friendly workflow for managing the virtual environment and tooling:

```bash
# Create/update .venv and install dev+test extras (Python 3.11+)
make install EXTRAS=dev,tests PYTHON=python3.11

# Drop into an activated shell (exit with 'exit' or Ctrl-D)
make shell

# Run linting or the full test suite
make lint
make test
```

Prefer scripts? `scripts/dev/dev-env.sh` remains available if you prefer driving the setup script directly:

```bash
# Fresh environment with test tooling and coverage plugins
./scripts/dev/dev-env.sh --fresh --with-tests --with-coverage

# Add parallel pytest workers
./scripts/dev/dev-env.sh --with-parallel
```

- `DEVENV_PYTHON` overrides the interpreter search (order: `python3.14`, `python3.13`, `python3.12`, `python3.11`, `python3`). Example: `DEVENV_PYTHON=python3.11 ./scripts/dev/dev-env.sh`.
- Manual setup: create a virtualenv and run `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. Layer optional extras like `.[tests]`, `.[coverage]`, or `.[parallel]` as needed.
- `scripts/maintenance/clean-env.sh` and `scripts/maintenance/clean-artifacts.sh` remove virtualenvs and cached outputs when you need a clean slate. Use `make clean-artifacts` or `make clean-cache` for the common paths, or call the script with `--artifacts-only` / `--cache-only` yourself; add `--reports` to prune `reports/`.
- Test coverage outputs land in `artifacts/coverage/` (HTML + XML). The `reports/` directory is reserved for CLI exports or cached metadata snapshots and is only pruned when you run `scripts/maintenance/clean-artifacts.sh --reports`.
- Script layout: `scripts/app/` (CLI wrappers), `scripts/dev/` (developer tooling), `scripts/maintenance/` (cache & environment cleanup).

## 🏗️ Package Architecture

The package follows Python best practices with a modular structure:

```
src/edugain_analysis/
├── core/                     # Core analysis logic
│   ├── analysis.py          # Main analysis functions
│   ├── metadata.py          # Metadata handling and XDG-compliant caching
│   └── validation.py        # URL validation with parallel processing
├── formatters/              # Output formatting
│   └── base.py             # Text, CSV, and markdown formatters
├── cli/                     # Command-line interfaces
│   ├── main.py             # Primary CLI (edugain-analyze)
│   ├── seccon.py           # Security contact CLI (edugain-seccon)
│   ├── sirtfi.py           # SIRTFI compliance CLI (edugain-sirtfi)
│   └── broken_privacy.py   # Broken privacy links CLI (edugain-broken-privacy)
└── config/                  # Configuration and patterns
    └── settings.py         # Constants and validation patterns
```

## 🔍 Privacy Statement URL Validation

The package includes a fast privacy statement URL validation system that checks link accessibility across eduGAIN federations. This helps identify broken privacy statement links that need attention.

### How It Works

1. **URL Collection**: Extracts privacy statement URLs from Service Provider (SP) metadata
2. **Parallel Checking**: Tests URLs concurrently using 16 threads for fast processing
3. **HTTP Status Validation**: Simple status code check:
   - **200-399**: Accessible (working link) ✅
   - **400-599**: Broken (needs fixing) ❌
4. **Real-time Progress**: Shows validation progress with visual indicators
5. **Smart Caching**: Results cached for 1 week to avoid re-checking unchanged URLs

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic validation with user-friendly summary
python analyze.py --validate

# Get detailed CSV with HTTP status codes for each URL
python analyze.py --csv urls --validate

# Export entities missing privacy statements
python analyze.py --csv missing-privacy
```

### Sample Output

The summary shows simple, actionable information:
```
🔗 Privacy Statement URL Check:
  📊 Checked 2,683 privacy statement links

  ╭─ 🔗 LINK STATUS SUMMARY ─────────────────────────────────╮
  │  ✅ 2,267 links working (84.5%) │
  │  ❌ 416 links broken (15.5%)    │
  ╰───────────────────────────────────╯
```

### CSV Export Details

When using `--csv urls --validate`, you get detailed technical information:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `StatusCode` | HTTP response code | `200`, `404`, `500` |
| `FinalURL` | URL after redirects | `https://example.org/privacy` |
| `Accessible` | Working status | `Yes` / `No` |
| `ContentType` | MIME type | `text/html` |
| `RedirectCount` | Number of redirects | `0`, `1`, `2` |
| `ValidationError` | Error details | `Connection timeout` |

This gives technical staff the specific information needed to fix broken links.

## 🔰 SIRTFI Coverage Tracking

The main analysis tools (`edugain-analyze`, `python analyze.py`) now include comprehensive SIRTFI (Security Incident Response Trust Framework for Federated Identity) certification tracking across all output formats.

### What is SIRTFI?

SIRTFI is a framework that enables the coordination of incident response activities for federated identity services. Entities with SIRTFI certification have committed to specific incident response capabilities and communication practices.

### Output Examples

**Summary Statistics** (includes SIRTFI section):
```
=== eduGAIN Quality Analysis: Privacy, Security & SIRTFI Coverage ===
Total entities analyzed: 10,234 (SPs: 6,145, IdPs: 4,089)

🔰 SIRTFI Certification Coverage:
  ✅ Total entities with SIRTFI: 4,623 out of 10,234 (45.2%)
  ❌ Total entities without SIRTFI: 5,611 out of 10,234 (54.8%)
    📊 SPs: 2,768 with / 3,377 without (45.0% coverage)
    📊 IdPs: 1,855 with / 2,234 without (45.4% coverage)
```

**CSV Entity Export** (includes `HasSIRTFI` column):
```csv
Federation,EntityType,OrganizationName,EntityID,HasPrivacyStatement,PrivacyStatementURL,HasSecurityContact,HasSIRTFI
InCommon,SP,Example University,https://sp.example.edu,Yes,https://example.edu/privacy,Yes,Yes
DFN-AAI,IdP,Test Institute,https://idp.test.de,N/A,N/A,Yes,No
```

**Federation Statistics CSV** (includes SIRTFI columns):
```csv
Federation,TotalEntities,TotalSPs,TotalIdPs,SPsWithPrivacy,SPsMissingPrivacy,EntitiesWithSecurity,EntitiesMissingSecurity,SPsWithSecurity,SPsMissingSecurity,IdPsWithSecurity,IdPsMissingSecurity,EntitiesWithSIRTFI,EntitiesMissingSIRTFI,SPsWithSIRTFI,SPsMissingSIRTFI,IdPsWithSIRTFI,IdPsMissingSIRTFI,SPsWithBoth,SPsWithAtLeastOne,SPsMissingBoth
InCommon,3450,2100,1350,1890,210,2760,690,1680,420,1080,270,1552,1898,945,1155,607,743,1575,2058,42
```

**Markdown Reports** (includes per-federation SIRTFI statistics):
```markdown
## Federation Analysis

### InCommon (3,450 entities: 2,100 SPs, 1,350 IdPs)

**SIRTFI Certification:** 🟢 1,552/3,450 (45.0%)
  ├─ SPs: 🟡 945/2,100 (45.0%)
  └─ IdPs: 🟡 607/1,350 (45.0%)
```

### Key Points

- **Applies to Both SPs and IdPs**: Unlike privacy statements (SP-only), SIRTFI applies to both entity types
- **Always Included**: The `HasSIRTFI` column is automatically included in all entity CSV exports
- **Federation Breakdown**: Per-federation statistics show SIRTFI coverage at the federation level
- **Color-Coded Status**: 🟢 (≥80%), 🟡 (50-79%), 🔴 (<50%) for visual feedback

For SIRTFI compliance validation and finding violations, use the specialized tools:
- `edugain-seccon`: Find entities with security contacts but without SIRTFI (potential candidates)
- `edugain-sirtfi`: Find entities with SIRTFI but without security contacts (compliance violations)

## 💾 Cache Management

All data is stored in XDG-compliant cache directories:

**Cache Location by Platform:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/edugain-analysis/`
- Linux: `~/.cache/edugain-analysis/`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\edugain\edugain-analysis\Cache\`

**Cache Files:**
- `metadata.xml` - eduGAIN metadata (expires after 12 hours)
- `federations.json` - Federation name mappings (expires after 30 days)
- `url_validation.json` - URL validation results (expires after 7 days)

**Cache Management Commands:**
```bash
# View cache location
python -c "from platformdirs import user_cache_dir; print(user_cache_dir('edugain-analysis', 'edugain'))"

# Clear cache to force fresh download
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/edugain-analysis/metadata.xml  # macOS
rm -rf ~/.cache/edugain-analysis/metadata.xml           # Linux
```

## 🏗️ Recent Improvements (v2.4.3)

**CLI & Tooling:**
- 🧭 `make help` now guides everyday CLI users vs. contributors with tone-matched sections (“Run the CLI”, “Develop or extend the app”, “Maintenance”).
- 🧹 Maintenance scripts live under `scripts/maintenance/`, dev helpers under `scripts/dev/`, and app wrappers under `scripts/app/`, so you can run CLIs without installing and keep automation clean.
- 🧪 `scripts/dev/local-ci.sh` mirrors CI locally (lint, tests, coverage, Docker) and respects `SKIP_COVERAGE` / `SKIP_DOCKER` toggles.

## 🐳 Run via Docker

The Docker image ships with the package pre-installed inside `/opt/venv` and exposes the CLI entry points through a lightweight entrypoint script:

```bash
# Build once (respects DEVENV_PYTHON and INSTALL_EXTRAS build args)
docker compose build

# Run the main analyzer (defaults to edugain-analyze when no args are given)
docker compose run --rm cli -- --report --output artifacts/report.md

# Run other CLIs by overriding the command
docker compose run --rm cli edugain-seccon --summary
docker compose run --rm cli edugain-broken-privacy --validate
```

Pip downloads and eduGAIN metadata caches are persisted in the named volumes declared in `docker-compose.yml` (`pip-cache`, `edugain-cache`). Remove them with `docker volume rm` if you need a cold start. The project folder is still bind-mounted into `/app`, so anything written to `reports/` or `artifacts/` is immediately available on the host.
