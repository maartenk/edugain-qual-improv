## Architecture Notes

- **Database Schema**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM (XDG-compliant cache location)
- **Frontend**: HTMX + PicoCSS + Chart.js (no build step, minimal JavaScript)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templates
- **Data Flow**: CLI analysis → SQLite → FastAPI → HTMX partials
- **Caching Strategy**: XDG cache directory for metadata, federation mappings, URL validation

## Related Files

- **Web App**: `src/edugain_analysis/web/app.py` (FastAPI routes)
- **Models**: `src/edugain_analysis/web/models.py` (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Data Import**: `src/edugain_analysis/web/import_data.py` (CLI → DB sync)
- **Templates**: `src/edugain_analysis/web/templates/` (Jinja2 + HTMX)
- **Core Analysis**: `src/edugain_analysis/core/analysis.py` (Business logic)
- **URL Validation**: `src/edugain_analysis/core/validation.py` (Parallel HTTP checks)

## Testing Priorities

After implementing each feature:
1. Add unit tests in `tests/unit/test_web_*.py`
2. Test HTMX partial rendering with different parameters
3. Verify database queries are indexed and performant
4. Test with large datasets (1000+ entities)
5. Validate responsive design on mobile devices

## Future Considerations (Beyond MVP)

- [ ] Real-time notifications for data updates
- [ ] Email alerts for federation compliance changes
- [ ] Multi-user support with authentication
- [ ] API rate limiting and caching headers
- [ ] WebSocket support for live updates
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard with custom queries
- [ ] PDF report generation
- [ ] Integration with external monitoring systems
